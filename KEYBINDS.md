## Available controller inputs (Oculus)

> Primary button and secondary button correspond to A, B and X, Y on the left and right controller.
>
> So Y would be the left controller, secondary button.

> Menu buttons may not be accessible because they're most likely intercepted by the headset or SteamVR
