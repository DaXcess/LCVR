# 1.0.0

**The VR mod has finally released!!**

Finally, after almost exactly two months <sub><sup>_(started Nov 19th 2023)_</sup></sub> of hard work the Lethal Company VR mod has it's first release!

No changelogs are necessary for this version, as it is the first version. Subsequent versions will contain a list of changes and new contributors.

### Verifying mod signature

LCVR comes pre-packaged with a digital signature. You can use tools like GPG to verify the `LCVR.dll.sig` signature with the `LCVR.dll` plugin file.

The public key which can be used to verify the file is [9422426F6125277B82CC477DCF78CC72F0FD5EAD (OpenPGP Key Server)](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/9422426F6125277B82CC477DCF78CC72F0FD5EAD).
