# Lethal Company VR Mod
Collecting Scrap in VR

## TODO

- [ ] Complete controller support
- [ ] Get the correct FOV based on the headset being used. It looks like Unity somehow knows this already, just gotta figure out how to extract it.
- [ ] Build a working XRRig (or feasible alternative), that correctly applies player rotation based on head rotation
- [ ] Maybe hand movement based on controller movement? Would be cool for flashlights and stuff. Will have to check how item pickup/interactions will work though.
- [ ] Fix the item pickup/interact raycasting (currently still requires mouse input, even though it looks like nothing is happening)
- [ ] Fix non-player cameras (spectating, ship leaving after death, etc)
- [ ] Correctly display HUD by moving them to World Position and updating it's position/rotation based on HMD
- [ ] Probably a whole lot more, expect this list to be updated frequently
